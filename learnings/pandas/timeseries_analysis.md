# Time series analysis with pandas

ChatSonic:

Some important functions used for time series analysis with pandas:

* `resample()`: This function can be used to resample the time series data to a different frequency, such as from daily to monthly data. In this example, we resample the data to daily frequency using the `D` argument and then sum the data for each day using the `sum()` function.
* `shift()`: This function can be used to shift the data by a certain number of periods, such as shifting the data back by two days. In this example, we shift the data back by two periods using the `shift()` function.
* `rolling()`: This function can be used to calculate rolling window statistics, such as a rolling average or rolling sum. In this example, we calculate a rolling window average of the data using a window size of 3 periods.

Here are some important pandas functions for time series analysis:

1. pd.to_datetime(): Convert string or epoch time to pandas datetime format
2. pd.date_range(): Create a range of dates or times
3. pd.Series(): Create a pandas series with dates as the index
4. resample(): Group data by time period and apply aggregate function
5. shift(): Shift data by a given time period
6. rolling(): Apply a rolling window function to the data
