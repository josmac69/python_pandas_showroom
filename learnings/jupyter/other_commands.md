In addition to hotkeys and magic commands, there are several other important commands and features to be aware of when using Jupyter Notebook:

* Saving and checkpointing the notebook (File > Save and Checkpoint).
* Downloading the notebook in various formats (File > Download as).
* Clearing output of all cells (Kernel > Restart & Clear Output).
* Accessing help documentation for various libraries and the Jupyter Notebook itself (Help).
