# Input formats for pandas

ChatSonic:

Pandas provides a wide range of I/O functions to read data from various file formats. Here's a comprehensive list of data formats that can be read by Pandas:

* CSV: `pd.read_csv()`
* Excel: `pd.read_excel()`
* JSON: `pd.read_json()`
* HTML: `pd.read_html()`
* XML: `pd.read_xml()`
* LaTeX: `pd.read_latex()`
* SQL: `pd.read_sql()`
* SAS: `pd.read_sas()`
* STATA: `pd.read_stata()`
* SPSS: `pd.read_spss()`
* Google BigQuery: `pd.read_gbq()`
* Google Sheets: `pd.read_excel()` with `gspread` and `oauth2client` libraries
* Feather: `pd.read_feather()`
* Parquet: `pd.read_parquet()`
* Msgpack: `pd.read_msgpack()`
* HDF5: `pd.read_hdf()`
* SQL query (using SQLAlchemy): `pd.read_sql_query()`

It's important to note that some of these functions have additional parameters that you can use to customize the way the data is read. For example, you can specify the sheet name when reading an Excel file, or the SQL query when reading from a database.

Overall, Pandas provides a wide range of functions for reading data from various formats, making it a powerful tool for working with data in Python.

The pandas library can read data from a variety of data formats, including:

1. CSV (Comma Separated Values) - read_csv(), read_table()
2. Excel - read_excel()
3. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) - read_json()
4. SQL databases (such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite) - read_sql(), read_sql_table(), read_sql_query()
5. HTML tables - read_html()
6. Clipboard (to read data from the clipboard) - read_clipboard()
7. Python dictionaries - DataFrame.from_dict()
8. Fixed-width formatted text files - read_fwf()

In addition to these, pandas can also read data from other formats using third-party libraries or by defining custom readers.

The specific function to use for reading data from a particular format depends on the format. For example, to read a CSV file, you would use `read_csv()`. To read data from a PostgreSQL database, you would use `read_sql()` or one of its variants.

The functions generally take a file or data source as input, and return a pandas DataFrame object. The DataFrame is a two-dimensional table-like data structure that allows you to manipulate and analyze the data in various ways.
