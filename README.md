# Show room demonstating usage of Python Pandas for data analysis

I used Pandas a lot for data analysis but those scripts have been created for specific use cases for specific companies and their data so I cannot reference them. Therefore I created this "show room" demonstrating usage of pandas and related library.

I also used this oportunity to test programming with ChatGPT, ChatSonic and Github Copilot AIs. My experiences with these tools are generally very positive but it is necessary to ask properly formulated questions and also understand the code and do proper testing. 

### Data sources

For this show room I use different data sources:

* example PostgreSQL databases from repository - https://github.com/josmac69/postgresDBSamples
* sample data from internet:
  * [Pandas sample student DataFrame](https://www.plus2net.com/python/pandas-student.php)
  * 

### Environment

All databases and python examples run in docker containers.
